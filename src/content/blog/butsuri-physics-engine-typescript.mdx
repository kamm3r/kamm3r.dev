Butsuri is going to be pretty simple physics engine for now. Main use case for it is going to be games and the supporting package is three.js.

## Collision


## Dynamics

Butsuri has rigidbodies and softbodies dynamics.
Is solid body that doesn't deform or might slightly but it is barely noticeable.
Usually used in character controllers

```ts
import { Rigidbody2D } from 'butsuri/2d'
import { Softbody } from 'butsuri/3d'

// rigidbody 2d setup
const rigidbody = new Rigidbody2D('circle', [1, 1])

// sofbody setup
const softbody = new Softbody('box', [1, 1, 1])

```
## Geometry

- Box
- Capsule
- Plane
- ConvexMesh
- TriangleMesh
- HeightField

## Math

[Senkei](https://github.com/kamm3r/senkei) is going to be the math library that I'm going to use.

## Conclusion

Current plan is going to look something like this.
