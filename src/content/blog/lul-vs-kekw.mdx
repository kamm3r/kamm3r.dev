## LULW Emote Origin

The LuLW emote is actually a variation of the original Lul emote. Before we can find the origin of LuLW we need to take a look at LuL.

LuL was originally uploaded to Twitch back in 2014 and stands for “Lame Uncomfortable Laugh”. It was uploaded to Twitch by Total Biscuit however shortly after it was uploaded the original photographer , Jonathan Tayag, requested it be taken down and Twitch complied.

However after some negotiation Jonathan agreed that the photo could be used as long as it was for free and not used for Subscription perks. It then became one of the most popular emotes on Twitch.

LuLW is a variation of the the LuL emote with a more zoomed view of the face.

## KEKW Emote Origin

Since 2019 KEKW has been one of the most popular emotes on twitch and is slowly but surely replacing LUL and LULW. Chances are if you’ve ever visited a twitch stream you have seen it being used in chat.

KEKW originally comes from a Spanish viral video of a man laughing combined with slang from world of Warcraft. You can see the original Spanish video down below.

The original video features Juan Joya Borja who is a Spanish comedian. You can
see what is being said in the video by reading the subtitles. The video
originally went viral due to the way the Spanish man laughs. This was then
turned into the emote on Twitch.

The emote was popularised in 2019 by streamers such as XQC and AdmiralBullDog. It’s usage spiked in 2020 and is slowly taking over LUL and LULW.
